Database Structure
The database consists of four tables:

Orders: Stores information about each order, including the order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.

Order_Details: Contains details of each pizza ordered in an order, including the order detail ID, order ID, pizza ID, quantity, and subtotal.

Pizza_Types: Represents the types or categories of pizzas available.

Pizzas: Stores information about individual pizza options, including the pizza ID, name, size, and price.

Sample Data
Sample data is provided in the insert_data.sql file, which contains SQL INSERT statements to populate the database with sample data. To use the sample data, simply execute the insert_data.sql script in your MySQL database.

SQL Queries
The project includes SQL queries for basic analysis (e.g., total orders, total revenue), intermediate analysis (e.g., order distribution by hour, top-selling pizza types), and advanced analysis (e.g., revenue contribution by pizza type, cumulative revenue).

Analysis Results
Summarize the key findings or results of your analysis. You can include charts, graphs, or tables to visualize the data if applicable.
